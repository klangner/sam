# Find structure in text documents.

Structure is determined by features, which can be simple like: line, word or can group in more complex
features like URL, json, markdown or fragment of Lisp code. 


## Installation

The library can be installed from [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sam) or build from source:

```sh
stack setup
stack build
stack test
```

We are happy to receive bug reports, fixes, documentation enhancements,
and other improvements.

Please report bugs via the
[github issue tracker](http://github.com/klangner/purescript-stats/issues).

This library is roughly port of the Haskell library: https://github.com/bos/statistics

It means that is is good for beginniners wanting to learn PureScript! 
You can find ideas and base implementation for functionality in this Haskell library. 
Easier then starting from the scratch.
