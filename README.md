# Find structure in text documents.

Structure is determined by features, which can be simple like: line, word or can group in more complex
features like URL, json, markdown or fragment of Lisp code. 


## Installation

The library can be installed from [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sam) or build from source:

```sh
stack setup
